# XDuskAshes / Dusk / XDuskAshesReal

Welcome. Glad to have you.

Remember: Giving up in any way is admittance of defeat. Be yourself. Stay yourself.

Godspeed, fellow Americans in danger.

## Who are you?
I'm Dusk. I primarily make stuff for [ComputerCraft:Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked). I'm working on making my code better and branching out into different languages such as C or Python, and shell scripting (primarily BASH). I'm a very bad programmer. I might make [gists](https://gist.github.com/XDuskAshes) sometimes for the smaller stuff.
