-- Why Dawn OS failed --

This is really a multi-part thing.

+=== Poor decision making ===+

I went in blind, not doing any research or anything. It upended
into a mess soon after. I reached out for help, but everything
was already a scribbled-up mess that barely worked.

+=== Poor discipline ===+

I didn't pace myself, mostly. I kept jumping to every little thing
without making sure core parts actually worked. I got burnt out
faster than eggs left to sit in a high-heat pan.

+=== Loss of interest ===+

I lost interest, steam, whatever you wanna call it. I lost the
excitement I got creating it in the beginning. It didn't feel
fun anymore, and barely anyone used it anyways.
